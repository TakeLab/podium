   "source": [
    "We have earlier mentioned special tokens, but now is the time to elaborate on what exactly they are. In Podium, each special token is a subclass of the python `str` which also encapsulates the functionality for adding that special token in the tokenized sequence. The `Vocab` handles special tokens differently -- each special token is guaranteed a place in the `Vocab`, which is what makes them... *special*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since our idea of special tokens was made to be extensible, we will take a brief look at how they are implemented, so we can better understand how to use them. We mentioned that each special token is a subclass of the python string, but there is an intermediary -- the `Special` base class. The `Special` base class implements the following functionality, while still being an instance of a string:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Extending the constructor of the special token with a default value functionality. The default value for each special token should be set via the `default_value` class attribute, while if another value is passed upon creation, it will be used.\n",
    "  2. Adds a stub `apply` method which accepts a sequence of tokens and adds the special token to that sequence. In its essence, the apply method is a post-tokenization hook (applied to the tokenized sequence after other post-tokenization hooks) which doesn't see the raw data whose job is to add the special token to the sequence of replace some of the existing tokens with the special token. The special tokens are applied after all post-tokenization hooks in the order they are passed to the `Vocab` constructor. Each concrete implementation of a Special token has to implement this method.\n",
    "  3. Implements singleton-like hash and equality checks. The `Special` class overrides the default hash and equals and instead of checking for string value equality, it checks for *class name equality*. We use this type of check to ensure that each `Vocab` has a single instance of each Special and for simpler referencing and contains checks.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a number of special tokens used throughout NLP for a number of purposes. The most frequently used ones are the unknown token (UNK), which is used as a catch-all substitute for tokens which are not present in the vocabulary, and the padding token (PAD), which is used to nicely pack variable length sequences into fixed size batch tensors.\n",
    "Alongside these two, common special tokens include the beginning-of-sequence and end-of-sequence tokens (BOS, EOS), the separator token (SEP) and the mask token introduced in BERT (MASK).\n",

(2) the Vocabularies for the Fields with the same name **have to be equal**. This is, of course, to avoid the issue where the same word maps to different indices between vocabularies. This is achieveable either by using a shared vocabulary in same Fields of the datasets from the beginning or by defining a `field_override` map, which directs data from the sub-datasets through the new Field.\n",
