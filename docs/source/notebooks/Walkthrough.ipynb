We will only scratch the surface of customizing Fields in this section.\n",

If the columns in your dataset are named (as they are in the SST dataset), you should define this mapping as a **dictionary** where the keys are the names of the input data columns, while the values are Fields. The name of the Field affects only the attribute where the data for that Field will be stored, and not the input column! This is due to the fact that it more complex datasets, you might want to map a single input column to multiple Fields.\n",

    "- `tokenizer` (str | callable | optional): The tokenizer for sequential data. You can pass a string to use a predefined tokenizer or pass a python callable which performs tokenization (e.g. a function or a class which implements `__call__`). For predefined tokenizers, you should follow the name-args argument formatting convention. You can use `'split'` for the `str.split` tokenizer (has no additional args) or `'spacy-en'` for the spacy english tokenizer. If the data Field should not be tokenized, this argument should be None. Defaults to `'split'`.\n",
    "- `numericalizer` (Vocab | callable | optional): The method to convert tokens to indices. Traditionally, this argument should be a Vocab instance but users can define their own numericalization function and pass it as an argument. Custom numericalization can be used when you want to ensure that a certain token has a certain index for consistency with other work. If `None`, numericalization wonâ€™t be attempted.\n",
    "- `is_target` (bool): Whether this data Field is a target field (will be used as a label during prediction). This flag serves merely as a convenience, to separate batches into input and target data during iteration.\n",
    "- `fixed_length` (int, optional): Usually, text batches are padded to the maximum length of an instance in batch (default behavior). However, if you are using a fixed-size model (e.g. CNN without pooling) you can use this argument to force each instance of this Field to be of `fixed_length`. Longer instances will be right-truncated, shorter instances will be padded.\n",
