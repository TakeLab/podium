Traditionally, this argument should be a Vocab instance but users can define their own numericalization function and pass it as an argument. Custom numericalization can be used when you want to ensure that a certain token has a certain index for consistency with other work. If `None`, numericalization won't be attempted.\n",

However, if you are using a fixed-size model (e.g. CNN without pooling) you can use this argument to force each instance of this Field to be of `fixed_length`. Longer instances will be right-truncated, shorter instances will be padded.\n",
